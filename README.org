* TODO Description :unfold:

TODO topic sentence

- A 'port' of Doom's leader and localleader bindings to Meow's Keypad state.

- A cursor configuration that uses the 'bar' cursor shape to indicate the way
  Emacs' cursor positioning differs from other modal editors, with
  ~cursor-blink-mode~ rather than a shape change to indicate a switch to Insert
  state.

- Numerous other tweaks, including to the suggested bindings, to integrate with
  Doom better.

TODO note: minimal modal 'layer'; do Emacs tutorial, Evil users

** Maintainers
- [[doom-user:][@nobody]]

[[doom-contrib-maintainer:][Become a maintainer?]]

** TODO Module flags
- +qwerty, +dvorak, etc :: Set up Meow's suggested bindings for the respective
  layouts. If you don't use any of these, you will need to set up bindings
  yourself; see (link to docs) for examples.
  You will probably want to look at the files responsible for setting up the
  bindings (in this module's =autoload/= directory) in order to be aware of any
  tweaks applied.

** Packages
- [[doom-package:meow]]

** Hacks
- The localleader bindings are accomplished via a hack.

** TODO Changelog
# This section will be machine generated. Don't edit it by hand.
/This module does not have a changelog yet./

* Installation

~mkdir -p ~/.doom.d/modules/editor && git clone <this-module-url> ~/.doom.d/modules/editor/meow~

[[id:01cffea4-3329-45e2-a892-95a384ab2338][Enable this module in your ~doom!~ block.]]
(add =(meow +your-desired-flags...)= after the =:editor= section in =init.el=)

The leader and localleader bindings are defined in [[doom-module::default
+bindings]], so that module is required for them to work.

This module will not work smoothly with [[doom-module::editor evil]],
[[doom-module::editor god]], or [[doom-module::editor objed]]. You must disable those
modules in your ~doom!~ block to use this one.

* TODO Usage
#+begin_quote
 󱌣 /This module's usage documentation is incomplete./ [[doom-contrib-module:][Complete it?]]
#+end_quote

Please refer to Meow's docs (TODO link) for any information not related to Doom
or this module.

** TODO Leader and localleader integration
Briefly explain how it's implemented (Keypad, M-SPC, etc) and how to bind keys
to them.

* TODO Configuration
#+begin_quote
 󱌣 /This module's configuration documentation is incomplete./ [[doom-contrib-module:][Complete it?]]
#+end_quote

** TODO Mode-specific Meow bindings
Link to the issue where this is discussed.

** TODO Disabling for certain modes
Explain EMACS state and how to use it.

** ~map!~ vs ~meow-define-keys~

Doom's ~map!~ and Meow's ~meow-define-keys~ are largely equivalent in terms of
functionality. ~(map! :map meow-normal-state-keymap ...)~ and ~(meow-define-keys
'normal ...)~ (and ~(meow-normal-define-keys ...)~) will do the same thing, as
far as this author is aware.

There is one exception - when binding a key to another key, ~meow-define-keys~
generates a command to execute that key, and binds to that. This isn't
explicitly supported by ~map!~, and when you try it, it binds the key directly
without a command wrapping it. This binding seems to get overridden by any
command bound to the same key.

** TODO changing 'word', 'symbol' definitions
Include if my PR gets merged.

* Troubleshooting
[[doom-report:][Report an issue?]]

** Prefix key descriptions in =which-key= popup
These do not show up properly when Keypad state is used. It is unclear where to
look for the source of the problem. The previous module also had [[https://github.com/meow-edit/doom-meow/issues/5][this issue]].

** Undo and [[doom-package:undo-fu]]
Meow's ~meow-undo~ expects the command bound to ~meow--kbd-undo~ (default =C-/=)
to behave like Emacs' built-in ~undo~ command. Undo-Fu remaps this command to
~undo-fu-only-undo~, which behaves differently, so ~meow-undo~ doesn't work
properly. Currently, the only workaround is to stop using Undo-Fu and learn
Emacs' default undo mechanism:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; In $DOOMDIR/packages.el
(package! undo-fu :disable t)
#+end_src
